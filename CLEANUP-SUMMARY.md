# Workspace Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up the Azure Guest Configuration workspace, removing development artifacts and organizing the production-ready automation.

## Files Removed (79 total)
- **30+ Fix-*.ps1 scripts** - Development/debugging scripts used during policy creation
- **Backup files** - *.backup files
- **Development documentation** - COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION-*.md files
- **Redundant scripts** - Duplicate functionality (Create-Initiatives.ps1, Import-AzurePolicies.ps1, etc.)
- **Log files** - Development and debugging logs
- **Sample files** - JSON examples in root directory
- **Legacy directory** - Old GuestConfiguration folder

## Essential Files Retained
